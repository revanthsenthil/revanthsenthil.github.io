In this paper, we present UPPLIED: a novel path-planning framework for UAV-based visual inspection of large structures. Leveraging demonstrated trajectories, UPPLIED generates new, optimized paths for inspecting similar structures, maintaining geometric consistency and targeted region focus. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through various experiments, showcasing its capability to adapt inspection trajectories across different structures with minimal deviation.
